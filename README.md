## Preparation
We are going to use Python for our simulations and Jupyter Notebook to have an interactive Python environment. If you are familiar with Python, you can use Python the way you'd like. But I suggest installing Jupyter Notebook at hand because I will give the exercises and notes in Jupyter Notebook Format (ipyb).

If you've never used Python, the easiest way to get Python and to run Jupyter Notebooks is by installing `Anaconda`. You should install the individual edition, which is free to use.

You can find the installers here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution  
You should use a Python 3 (for instance 3.9) version. 

Although we will use it rarely, also it would be a plus to get familiarize running your operating system's command-line interface. In Windows, `Command Line Prompt` or `Powershell` can be used. In macOS and Linux, you have the `Terminal`. 

After installing `python` and `anaconda`, you verify that they are installed properly by entering command line: 
```
python --version
```
or 
```
python3 --version
```

and 

```
conda --version
```
You should be seeing something like `Python 3.9.1` and `Anaconda 4.4.10` depending on your version.

If you fail to install Anaconda, we will have some time before the second session starts. If you come to the second class 10-15 minutes earlier, I can help you install it. We will not use Python in the first session.

## Prerequisites
There are no prequisites, but it would be helpful if you have some other programming tool experience. You don't really need to practice anything before the workshop, although if you'd like, you can take a look at Python basics. In the second (optional) session, we will cover Python basics anyways. 

I will upload the slides and notes here shortly before each class.
