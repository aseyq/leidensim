## Preperation
We are going to use Python for our simulations and Jupyter Notebook to have an interactive Python environment. If you are familiar with Python, you can use Python the way you'd like. But I suggest to install Jupyter Notebook at hand because I will give the excercises and notes in Jupyter Notebook Format (ipyb).

If you've never used Python, the easiest way to get Python run Jupyter Notebooks is by installing `Anaconda`. You should install the individual edition, which is free to use.

You can find the installers here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution You should use a Python 3 (for instance 3.9) version. 

Although we will use rarely, also you should probaby get familiar with your operating system's command line interface. In Windows, `Command Line Prompt` or `Powershell` can be used. In macOS and Linux, you have the `Terminal`. 

After installing `python` and `anaconda`, you verify that they are installed properly by entering command line: 
```
python --version
```
or 
```
python3 --version
```

and 

```
conda --version
```

## What to Practice before the workshop
You don't need to practice anything before the workshop. Although if you'd like, you can take a look at Python basics. The second session we will have will be about Python basics anyways. 

If you fail to install Anaconda, we will have some time before the second session starts. If you come to the second class 10-15 minutes earlier, I can help you install it. We will not use Python in the first session.
