## Agent-Based Model Frameworks
They are aimed to help you:
    - Create a world (grid, network, etc.)
    - Shorten the development time
    - Help you run faster simulations

## Frameworks

[List of frameworks-Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_agent-based_modeling_software)

## Python Frameworks
- [Repast4py](https://repast.github.io/repast4py.site/index.html)
- [Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [AgentPy](https://agentpy.readthedocs.io/)

## AgentPy framework
- Simple Syntax
- Beginner Friendly
- Jupyter Friendly

## AgentPy Components
- `Agent`

- Environments
    - `Grid`: A matrix of cells
    - `Network`: A network of nodes
    - `Space`: A continous space

- `Model`

- `Experiment`

## Creating an Agent

```{python}
import agentpy as ap

class MyAgent(ap.Agent):
    def setup(self):

        self.payoff = 0

    def do_something(self):
        self.payoff += 1
```
- `.setup()` is like `__init__` but it automatically inherits from `ap.Agent` variables. (i.e. no need to call `super().__init__()`)

- Just like `__init__()`, it will be called automatically when the agent is created.

## Automated links to simulation objects

:::{.incremental}
- `myagent.model`: Model instance agent is in
    - For instance `myagent.model.grid`: Grid instance agent is in
- `myagent.id`: Agent ID
- `p`: Parameter dictionary
- `log`: Recorded variables
:::


## Model

```{python}
class MyModel(ap.Model):

    def setup(self):
        """ Initiate a list of new agents. """
        self.agents = ap.AgentList(self, self.p.num_agents, MyAgent)

    def step(self):
        """ Call a method for every agent. """
        # do something during the round
        self.agents.do_something()

    def update(self):
        """ Record a dynamic variable. """
        # do something at the end of the round
        self.record('average_payoff', sum(self.agents.payoff)/len(self.agents))

    def end(self):
        """ Report an evaluation measure. """
        self.report('my_measure', 1)
```

<br>

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
parameters = {'num_agents': 10, 'steps': 4}
new_model = MyModel(parameters)
results = new_model.run()
```

## Results

```{python}
#| output-location: column-fragment
print(results)

```

<br>

. . .

```{python}
#| output-location: column-fragment
print(results.info)

```

<br>

. . .

```{python}
#| output-location: column-fragment
print(results.variables.MyModel)

```


## Model components: `setup(self)`
```{python}
class MyModel(ap.Model):

  def setup(self):
    self.agents = ap.AgentList(self, self.p.num_agents, MyAgent)
    print("hi")
    print(self.agents)
  
```

- Create the agents

#### `ap.AgentList(self, num_agents, agent_class)`
- We no longer need to create a loop for agent creation. `AgentList` does it by itself.


## Model components: `step(self)`
```{.python}
class MyModel(ap.Model):
# ...
    def step(self):
        """ Call a method for every agent. """
        # do something during the round
        self.agents.do_something()
# ...
```

- This is where we do the main work of the model. What happens in each round?

- We no longer have to run a loop over all the agents. 

- `self.agents.do_something()` runs `do_something()` for every agent.


## Model components: `update(self)`
```{.python}

class MyModel(ap.Model):
# ...
def update(self):
        """ Record a dynamic variable. """
        # do something at the end of the round
        self.record('average_payoff', sum(self.agents.payoff)/len(self.agents))
# ...
```

- This is where we record the dynamic variables.
- If we need something to calculate only at the end of the round, this would be the place.

## Model components: `end(self)`

```{.python}
class MyModel(ap.Model):
#...
    def end(self):
        """ Report an evaluation measure. """
        some_measure = calculate_measure()
        self.report('my_measure', some_measure)
```

- You can run things at the end of the simulation
- You can record measures belong to the general simulation at the end. Such as summary statistics.


## Running a simulation

- Model parameters are defined in a dictionary. 

- Then it is plugged into a model

```{.python}
parameters = {
    'my_parameter':42,
    'agents':10,
    'steps':10
}

model = MyModel(parameters)
```
<br>

. . .

- Then the model is run by model.run(). It returns a `Results` object which contains useful information about the simulation.

```{.python}
results = model.run()
```

## Model Procedure

1. The model initializes with the time-step `Model.t = 0`.

2. `Model.setup()` and Model.update() are called.

3. The model’s time-step is increased by 1.

4. `Model.step()` and `Model.update()` are called.

5. Step 2 and 3 are repeated until the simulation is stopped.

6. `Model.end()` is called.

[https://agentpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html](https://agentpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#structure)

## Stopping the model
- Calling the `Model.stop()` during the simulation.

- Reaching the time-limit, which be defined as follows:

  - Defining steps in the paramater dictionary.

  - Passing steps as an argument to `Model.run()`.

```{python}
parameters = {
    'my_parameter': 42,
    'agents': ap.IntRange(10, 20),
    'steps': ap.IntRange(10, 20)
}
sample = ap.Sample(parameters,n=10)
print(sample)
```

## Practice

## Spatial ABM's
![](images/seggregation.png)

:::{.incremental}
- Spatial ABM's are models that use a space to represent the world.
- Usually a torus/donut shape is used.
- Can be:
  - Continuous
  - Gred
  - Network
::: 

## Schelling's Seggregation Model
- ![](images/seggregation.png)

:::{.incremental}
- 20x20 grid
- Each cell is a house in the grid
- Each agent live in a grid
- There are two races
- Each agent is happy at least a proportion of agents are like them
:::

## Practice

## Consistency Analysis
- How many times should I repeat the model?

[@lee2015complexities]
Coefficient variation: ratio of SD. of a sample to its mean.
$$ c_v = \sigma / \mu $$

. . .

For increasing sample size calcuate the difference:

$$ E = c_v^501 - c_v^500 $$

Set a threshold of E. (0.01 is common)

## Sensitivity analysis
 - How robust are model results to changes parameters?
- Sensitivity analyses are techniques for estimating the effect of parameters on the simulation.

. . .

- Local sensitivity analysis : [@cariboni2007role]
  - The effect of a single parameter on the simulation.
  - Vary one parameter at a time.

. . . 

- Global Sensitivity Analysis
  - The effect of multiple parameters on the simulation.
  - Sample from simulations with different values of parameters.
  - For instances, regression based sensitivity analysis [@downing1985examination]

## Future of Agent-Based Modeling
- Developments in Machine Learning Models would affect ABM. [@rand2006machine]
![](images/randmachine.png)

- Assignment:

:::{.incremental}
  - Go back to our PD simulation
  - Keep only Randomer agent
  - Give a an attribute `p` stands for probability of cooperating. This should be randomly picked from a distribution.
  - Create an agent type `Regressor`
  - The agent decides to cooperate or defect based on the logistic regression results. `from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression` in order do exploit the opponent.
:::

## Next: Choosing a framework:
- You might not need a framework for all problems.
- If problems are visual and spatial, you might pick Netlogo.
- If you'd like to use external packages, you might pick Python based solutions.
- `AgentPy` is simple but growing. 
- 
- `Mesa` can be a good trade-off.
- If you are into Julia language, you can take a look at Agents.jl

## Closing
- We've covered the basics of Agent-Based Modeling.
- We saw a small subset of examples. If you need inspiration, you can check [Netlogo's Model Library](http://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/models/Sample%20Models/Social%20Science/Unverified/Prisoner's%20Dilemma/PD%20Basic%20Evolutionary.nlogo).
